Script only works for Windows

1. Top right corner green button Code > Download ZIP. Extract all contents in the same folder
2. (Paid Streams Only) The script will generate a cookies.txt file on first run. Replace the default cookies.txt with your own exported cookies.txt
3. Double click the Easy youtube-dl Script.bat
4. Paste the video URL
5. ???
6. The videos will be in the Recordings folder
7. Profit!

The script will work as is, but at a lower quality. Download [ffmpeg](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) to improve quality.
